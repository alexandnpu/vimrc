vimrc

## vimrc.basics

This is the least settings based on Vim builtin features and I think I feel the best. It is to avoid using of any plugins or external dependencies. The original idea is from provided copy from vimgolf.com.
I'll be updating it if any new idea.

## vimrc.full

This is for a copy for plain text and code editing, without limits on plugins.
